# Trivia-Game
Multiple choice trivia game project

//Pseudocoding
//===========================================
//You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

//* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

//* The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

//* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

//* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

//Nest a for loop inside of a for loop
//Countdown timer for each question; timer--
//+1 for correct answer or +1 for wrong answer
//Automatic reset that empties the previous question and moves you to the next question
//=========================================================

//Still-To-Do list
//How do I separate answer sets so that each set of four choices corresponds only to one question? (array indexes?)
    //Problem- showing each answer subarray 3 times in the console; not resetting but continues appending questions
    //Problem- how to incorporate a for-loop to solve the above problem and tell the computer the answer sets are separate?

//How do I connect your answer responses to the rightCount and wrongCount counters?
    //counter at least shows up in the console after game is over
//How do I submit your answers and reset the game?
